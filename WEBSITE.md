Create a simple website that makes a slideshow out of the images inside @ai-and-the-future-of-engineering/

Each subfolder (sorted alphabetically) represents one slide. The slides are presented in subfolder order.

- If a subfolder contains a single image, show it as a full-page slide.
- If a subfolder contains multiple images, show them as a clickable gallery (click to enlarge, click again to exit).
- `.yaml` files in a subfolder describe embeds (e.g. x.com posts, linkedin posts) rather than images. Read the yaml to determine what to embed.
- `11g-linkedin.png` is a linkedin post to be embedded — use the png as the gallery thumbnail and embed the actual post only in the popup window.

It should allow back and forth between slides, start on the first one, and after the last slide should show a Thank You page. Before the first slide should be a title page with "AI and the Future of Engineering". Make the font and background look cool. Make sure the bg goes to the full width and height of the page.

Everything should be centered horizontally and vertically on the screen.

Make it as simple as possible, preferably raw html/css/js.

No need for testing.

Leave a dev server running for me to use when you're done.
