Create a simple website that makes a slideshow out of the images in order inside the folder @ai-and-the-future-of-engineering/

It should allow back and forth between the images, start on the first one, and after the last image should show a Thank You page. Also before the first image should be a page with title "AI and the future of Engineering". Make the font and background look cool. Make sure the bg goes to the full width and height of the page.

All the 09 images should be shown as a clickable gallery (exit with another click). Same with all the 10 images and 11 images. All others should be separate pages.

04a is an x.com post with a video that should be embedded in the page.

Everything should be centered horizontally and vertically on the screen.

Make it as simple as possible, preferably raw html/css/js.
